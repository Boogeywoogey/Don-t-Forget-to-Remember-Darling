	   <h1 class="text-calm">Holmes steps over the marble barrier and back onto the stones of the square, feet and bag dripping. 
	   She crouches and tucks her socks into her slip-ons, before dangling those from her fingertips. 
	   She turns towards the dorms, but a voice calling out stops her.
<br>
“Ms. Holmes, we have a standard here.” You recognize the Dean and manage pity this time. The hierarchy is coming into place and showing Holmes where she belongs. There’s no way the Dean didn’t know the reason for her actions; it’s just as clear that no one cares as long as they get the opportunity to cut down Holmes. “Fix your pants.” 
<br> The unsaid ‘No more pants’ echoes through the mind of every girl who can hear the Dean, including you.
<br>
Holmes looks down at her pants, then her full hands. Rather than set down her things, she says, “No, I don’t think I will.”
