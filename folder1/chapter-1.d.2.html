	   <h1 class="text-calm"> Maybe you can find a new friend, someone to study with. 
	   Maybe they'll even be smart enough to compete with you for top of the class, adding some competition to your boring and repetitious life.
	   But that hope is something dull, like that of an adult flicking a penny into a wishing well. Whether the student is type one or two doesn’t ultimately affect you, and is therefore not interesting enough to be worth much thought.
