<br>
Until your last class.

“Class! Settle,” Ms. Brighton calls, even though the only ongoings in the classroom prior were no more than hushed whispers. The sounds fade out and silence sits in their place. Ms. Brighton continues, “Today, as I’m certain you’ve heard, we have a new student. Come in, Ms. Holmes.”
And Ackley Holmes steps into the room.
<br>
You know immediately which category Ackley Holmes fits into; it’s obvious from her loosely buttoned shirt to her dangling tie, but even more so evident in the pants she’s wearing.
All the girls receive a uniform, and pants are an option, but you have never seen any girl wear them for longer than their first few days; it’s frowned upon here, to the extent that girls will tease the wearer in a rather ruthless manner.
