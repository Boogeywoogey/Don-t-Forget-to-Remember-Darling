	   <h1 class="text-calm"> Holmes’ attention diverts in a second, and the sensual grin is replaced by something more excited. 
	   She spreads her arms wide and says, “Master, you made it! I prepared your cauldron for you; I suspected you might be busy with your witchy tasks.” 
	   Holmes dips into a deep bow.
Behind Ms. Brighton, the class explodes into laughter. 
The woman herself fumbles, opening and closing her mouth and waving her hands about, searching for words. 
Holmes takes the cross and bows behind it, exclaiming, “Oh, please, Master, not a spell!” 
And the class’s laughter renews to a deafening volume. 
Even Ivy in her waning fury has to bite down on her cheek. When she realizes what she’s doing, she scowls, snatching the cross out of Holmes’ grip. 
Holmes has the audacity to look wounded.
That seems to be the vote of confidence that Ms. Brighton needed. She steps forward and seizes Holmes by her hair, ignoring the pained shouts of, “Hey, hey, not the hair!” and drags her out of the room. Everyone knows that the Dean is going to get an interesting visit, and that triggers another bout of choked laughter from the girls as they fill the room; most take pictures of the decorated desk.
“Man, isn’t Holmes amazing?”
“She’s hilarious!”
“She’s so brave.”
Ivy rolls her eyes and sits down at her desk, opening her novel; she suspects it’s going to take some time for the class to start.
