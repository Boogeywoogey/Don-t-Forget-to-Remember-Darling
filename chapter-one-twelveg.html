	   <h1 class="text-calm">You wonder if Holmes's stare is always this intense or if she senses something in you the way you do with her; a feeling that something is about to change. 
	   After a few moments, the teacher once again commands the attention of the room. “Ms. Holmes, you may take any open seat you see available. But know that the seat you choose will be your seat from now on, and that will not change.” 
	   Then, with one last glance, she begins her lecture.
	  <br> 
You don’t move your stare from Holmes even as she finally looks away. You watch with a muted fascination as Holmes looks around the room in consideration, before moving towards the desk right next to your’s and falling down into it, dropping her bag to the side.
The sudden confrontation startles you, so you focus on the lecture at the front of the room, but you still feel the weight of that stare on you during the entire first half of the ninety-minute class.
