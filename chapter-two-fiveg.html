<br>
To her credit, Holmes doesn’t startle; she glances up at her and back at her—yes, it is—cauldron. Around it are vials shaped in all forms and filled with all colored liquids, and to top it all off, a witch’s hat.
<br>
“Yep,” Holmes says, popping the ‘p’. She steps back and asks, “What time is it, Ivy?”
<br>
The use of her name disturbs her; Ivy is well known around the school, even popular for her polite charm and perfect grades. It is not unusual that someone she doesn’t know has her name. But it never occurred to her that Holmes might know it; 
the girl is a hurricane, a sweeping storm of confidence and defiance that flings order aside with the disinterest of an unamused child. It never occurred to her that she might have any presence in the mind of Holmes. 
For some reason, that realization is pleasing.
